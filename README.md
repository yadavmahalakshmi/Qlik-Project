# EXPLORING INSIGHTS FROM SYNTHETIC AIRLINE DATA ANALYSIS WITH QLIK

## This project focuses on using airline data to make flying better for passengers and more efficient for airlines. By analyzing data on passenger details, flight information, and customer feedback, we aim to find out why flights are delayed or canceled. With this information, we will develop strategies to improve flight schedules and reduce disruptions. The goal is to enhance on-time performance, optimize flight routes, and improve the overall travel experience for passengers. By using data-driven insights, we hope to make airline operations smoother and passengers happier.
